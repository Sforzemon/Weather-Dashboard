Navbar at the top of the screen
Weather Dashboard [search bar                       ] Icon of some sort

The left side will have a side sticky navbar
    Searched items will be stored in local storage and will be prepended to this search bar
    Clicking on one of these will run the seatch again.
    and will either move that object to the top of the navbar or will just add another one
        obviously moving would be ideal, but depending on time constraints will determine which one happens

On the rest of the screen we will have a jumbotron to span the remainder of the window.  In this jumbotron will show various weather details and an image

Below the jumbotron will be 5 cards to show the 5day forcast
    each of these should have an icon of some sort and be more than just a name and some numbers

because all locations, will be saved to local storage, what ever the last one searched should always populate when the window is opened.
    Considering putting a limit on how many can be saved to the local storage array.  10 might actually be a good number.  Also depends on time.

separate calls for weather, uv index, and five day.  Then a 4th url for the icons.
